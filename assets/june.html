                June started with the Sun's AR3664 sunspot unleashing two powerful X-class flares, causing radio
                blackouts on Earth. A celestial "Parade of Planets" on June 3 saw six planets align in a mesmerizing
                pre-dawn display. The June Solstice on June 21 marked the year's longest day, celebrating Earth's cosmic
                rhythms. India capped the month with Pushpak's successful autonomous landing on June 23, advancing
                reusable spaceÂ technology.

                                            Highly active AR3664 sunspot region released powerful solar flares recently,
                                            including two major X-class flares within under 12 hours. May 31 at 6:03
                                            p.m. EDT was the first X-class flare, while on June 1 at 4:48 a.m. EDT was
                                            the other. X-class is actually the strongest type of flare, and these two
                                            events measured X1.18 and X1.43 intensity. These flares happen due to
                                            magnetic reconnection, where the twisted magnetic field lines of the sun's
                                            plasma break and release tremendous energy. This causes explosions on the
                                            surface of the sun. These eruptions threw heavy radiation bursts towards
                                            Earth that caused radio blackouts in the affected areas. The first blackout
                                            hit the Western U.S. and the Pacific, while the second affected Europe,
                                            Africa, and Asia. The radiation ionized the upper atmosphere, thus making it
                                            denser. Such an environment interfered with high-frequency radio waves,
                                            which made it harder for radio signals to travel over long distances. These
                                            then weaken or fail entirely. Such blackouts are quite common during intense
                                            solar activity.

                                            On June 3, 2024, there was a spectacular celestial event when six planets
                                            aligned in the pre-dawn sky: Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
                                            Neptune. Such an alignment is sometimes referred to as a "planet parade." To
                                            an observer on Earth, alignments occur when multiple planets appear close
                                            together along the ecliptic plane. Yet, because of their distance from the
                                            Sun and the difference in brightness, not all these planets could be seen
                                            with the naked eye. Observers in the Northern Hemisphere who ventured out
                                            before sunrise could spot Mars and Saturn without optical aids, as they
                                            shone brightly enough to pierce through the morning twilight. Mercury and
                                            Jupiter were positioned low on the east-northeast horizon, their visibility
                                            hindered by the sun's glare, making them challenging to observe without
                                            binoculars or a telescope. Uranus and Neptune are much fainter and more
                                            distant and needed telescopic help and the darkest of skies to be observed.
                                            This alignment, though very captivating, reminded us of how our solar
                                            system's planetary positions are in a state of constant change.

                                            The spot on Earth directly under the Sun throughout the year is known as the
                                            subsolar point. This spot moves up and down along a north-south line
                                            throughout the year. It reaches its southernmost position on the December
                                            solstice and then begins to move northward. On the March equinox, it crosses
                                            the equator and continues north until it reaches its northernmost position
                                            on the June solstice. Then it reverses its direction and heads south. The
                                            term âsolsticeâ is derived from Latin, which uses the words sol for Sun and
                                            sistere to describe the act of standing still, describing how the Sun seems
                                            to stand still before reversing direction. With spring coming into summer,
                                            the Sun rises farther north and sets farther south with each passing day. By
                                            the solstice, it is at its highest point in the sky before starting again
                                            its slow journey southward.

                                        <p>Earth is tilted as it orbits the Sun, which is why equinoxes and solstices
                                            happen.

                                            India has just completed a series of experiments to exhibit its own
                                            self-made homegrown technology, wherein its reusable space plane is named
                                            Pushpak. The last test carried out on June 23, 2024 in Karnataka, proved a
                                            challenging experience where Pushpak did its precise horizontal landing
                                            under stringent conditions of landing. This marked a move for India in its
                                            ultimate target of achieving the reusable launch vehicle by the end of this
                                            decade. Such technology will make future space missions cheaper by allowing
                                            rockets to be reused. The test was led by the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre
                                            (VSSC) and involved releasing the 21-foot-long space plane from a Chinook
                                            helicopter at an altitude of 2.8 miles (4.5 km). Pushpak was intentionally
                                            released off-center from the runway to test its autonomous landing
                                            capabilities. The vehicle did maneuver itself, and in spite of very strong
                                            winds, landed accurately at the center of the runway. ISRO is working on
                                            taking this technology a little further ahead by sending the prototype into
                                            space for returns under autonomous control.
