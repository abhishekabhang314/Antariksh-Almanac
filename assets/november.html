                                        <p>On November 4th in the year 2024, precisely at 9:29 PM EST, SpaceX had
                                            successfully completed the launch of its 31st Commercial Resupply Services
                                            (CRS-31) mission toward the International Space Station from Launch Complex
                                            39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The Dragon spacecraft contained
                                            over 6,000 pounds of cargo including scientific experiments, provisions for
                                            the crew onboard, as well as necessary hardware for operations related to
                                            the ISS.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Certain scientific payloads comprised the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment
                                            (CODEX), which tipped its hat towards an end use for studying the properties
                                            of solar wind, and ARTEMOSS that used Antarctic moss for an experiment on
                                            plant responses to radiation exposure in space and microgravity. Other
                                            appendages included a materials sciences experiment that elucidates on aging
                                            in the space environment for certain materials, while an investigation into
                                            cold welding advances the in-situ repair development of spacecraft.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It was also the first and the only such reboost of the ISS through a Dragon
                                            on CRS-31. The Dragon fired its Draco thrusters for 12.5 minutes and then
                                            adjusted the orbit of the station to replace that lost from atmospheric drag
                                            on November 8, 2024. Such capability adds to the flexibility of operation of
                                            the ISS in terms of altitudinal maintenance.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It also left the Dragon spacecraft docked with the ISS for about six weeks.
                                            During this time, the crew off-loaded the non-proprietary cargo from the
                                            space vehicle and uploaded the research samples and equipment designated for
                                            return to Earth into it. The mission officially ended with the Dragon
                                            undocking on December 16, 2024, with a safe splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico
                                            to ensure the retrieval of precious scientific data and materials for
                                            further analysis.

                                        <p>The Taurid meteor shower occurs due to the debris left behind by Comet
                                            2P/Encke, with some additional material derived from Asteroid 2004 TG10.
                                            This shower is unique because it has two parts: the Southern Taurids and the
                                            Northern Taurids. Most of the Southern Taurids come from the comet, while
                                            debris from both the comet and the asteroid contributes to the Northern
                                            Taurids, which might actually be on a longer stream itself, perhaps part of
                                            a larger comet that broke apart long ago. Since the debris is distributed
                                            over vast stretches of space, Earth passes through it for a considerable
                                            period, producing these two streams. The usually low rate of meteors in the
                                            Taurids-approximately five to ten per hour-is typical for this meteor
                                            shower, but they are known for their bright, slow-moving meteors that light
                                            up the night sky. The explanation according to the Royal Museums Greenwich
                                            (RMG) is that the huge spread and size of the debris explain why this shower
                                            has two parts. For the stargazers, then, it gives a mellow yet beautiful
                                            event.

                                            The Leonids Meteor Shower was once such an awaited annual event for all
                                            meteor lovers and the amateur stargazer, because it reached its heights on
                                            the nights of November 17-18, 2024. The phenomenon associated with Comet
                                            55P/Tempel-Tuttle, which takes around 33 years to sweep back and forth from
                                            the Sun, leaves behind a residual trail of debris around its orbit. When our
                                            planet travels through this debris trail, the little tiny particles catch
                                            fire inside our atmosphere, forming streaks as meteors.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            During the peak period in 2024, Leonid showers brought around 14-15 meteors
                                            in an hour. Although the number is modest as compared to some meteor
                                            showers, the Leonids are known for their very fast and bright meteors which
                                            generally leave behind glowing trails known as persistent trains. Entering
                                            the Earth's atmosphere at velocities of up to 71 kilometers per second, they
                                            are definitely among the fastest meteors recorded.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This year, however, the full moon got in the way of observing since it
                                            pretty much washed out the faintest meteors. In spite of that, the brightest
                                            still came through for a little bit of a show for those who were willing to
                                            seek out the dark into the city lights. Primarily though, the best times to
                                            view the Leonids were in the early dawn hours, after midnight when the
                                            radiant point-the point in the sky from which the meteors apparently
                                            originate-was higher. This point is in the constellation Leo, which is how
                                            this meteor shower earned its name.

                                        <p>On November 18, 2024, India had the distinction of successfully getting
                                            GSAT-20 aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. In
                                            fact, this was the first time an Indian satellite was launched on a rocket
                                            based entirely in the US. GSAT-20 is a highly throughput communication
                                            satellite and weighs over 4,700 kilograms, aimed at revolutionising
                                            telecommunications architecture in India. This satellite will offer high-end
                                            broadband connectivity, which will support projects like smart cities and
                                            provide access to the internet even in remote and underprivileged regions.

                                        <p>
                                            The satellite was flown into geosynchronous transfer orbit after a flight of
                                            34 minutes. GSAT-20 was confirmed healthy by the Indian Space Research
                                            Organisation (ISRO) upon launch, and operations were immediately taken over
                                            by the Master Control Facility. Designed for an operational life span of 14
                                            years, GSAT-20 is optimally equipped to give a massive boost towards the
                                            Internet capability of India and assist in closing the digital divide in the
                                            country.

                                            This mission marks yet another advance towards international cooperation for
                                            India's space program. By taking advantage of such a hi-tech rocket as the
                                            Falcon 9 from SpaceX, India showed its commitment to use state-of-the-art
                                            technologies for national advancement. The successful deployment of GSAT-20
                                            is set to prove a booster for building India much more in digital
                                            infrastructure and connectivity, making the shift of India into a high-tech
                                            future and an economy-rich state.
